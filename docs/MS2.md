**Problem:** ShareCarCo  
**Interviewee profile:** Remote worker (London-based)  
**Interview Summary:** [audio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EqE7nnAEx-km2KQ92gW3oW4X6rkeQQbF?usp=sharing)

| # | Question | Purpose | Response |
|---|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Can you tell me about your current use of your car (or transportation routine if you don’t own one)? | Understand their baseline mobility habits and car ownership/use frequency. | Works remotely, rarely uses a car. Primarily uses it for countryside trips. Within London prefers public transport (Tube) due to crowding, or walking/cycling. Car use is mainly on weekends, occasionally with his girlfriend to dine out. |
| 2 | Have you ever considered renting out your car (or renting someone else’s) when it’s not in use? Why or why not? | Explore openness to the concept and initial perceptions of peer-to-peer car rental. | Has not considered it because he is unsure if companies offering that service exist nowadays. |
| 3 | What concerns or doubts would you have about letting someone else use your car? | Identify barriers such as trust, safety, insurance, and vehicle condition. | Main concern is cleanliness and whether the person would take proper care of the car. Lack of trust in strangers, uncertainty about their cleanliness and responsibility. |
| 4 | What features or guarantees would make you feel comfortable using a platform like this? | Discover key requirements for adoption (e.g., insurance coverage, vetting process, GPS tracking). | Assurance that the car will be returned completely clean (e.g., vacuumed) and in good condition. Ability to choose renters based on ratings/reviews within the app. |
| 5 | How do you currently handle situations when you need a car but don’t have access to one? | Understand the renter side’s needs, urgency, and willingness to pay. | In the city: uses bike or Tube. For countryside: takes train or rents a car if distance is far from city center. |
| 6 | What price or compensation would make renting out your car worthwhile for you? | Gauge the financial motivators and acceptable pricing models. | Depends on frequency. Would accept ~£100 per trip up to four times a month, or annual equivalent of £45K–50K if frequent. |
| 7 | If a service like ShareCarCo was launched in your city tomorrow, what would make you try it immediately—or what would stop you? | Identify strongest motivators and deal-breakers for adoption. | As a client: lower fares than London’s current services, faster and more reliable. As an owner: assurance of car’s return in clean and good condition, with a full tank. |

#### Situations
| Situation | What? | How? | Why? | Who? |
|-----------|-------|------|------|------|
| 1 | Owner rarely uses car during weekdays | Prefers Tube and walking to avoid city traffic | City is crowded, car is inefficient for daily commute | Remote worker in London |
| 2 | Hesitation to rent out car | Avoids renting to strangers without trust or proof of responsibility | Fears damage or poor maintenance of vehicle | Car owner concerned about cleanliness and care |
| 3 | Needs a vehicle for countryside trips | Rents a car or uses train when personal car not available | Trips are occasional and distance sometimes exceeds convenient train reach | Remote worker, occasional traveler |
| 4 | Willing to use platform if conditions met | Would adopt service if cleaning and vetting guarantees are provided | Wants assurance of safe return and positive user history | Potential P2P car-sharing participant |
