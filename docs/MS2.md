**Interview Summary:** [audio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EqE7nnAEx-km2KQ92gW3oW4X6rkeQQbF?usp=sharing)

| # | Question | Purpose | Response |
|---|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Can you tell me about your current use of your car (or transportation routine if you don’t own one)? | Understand their baseline mobility habits and car ownership/use frequency. | Works remotely, rarely uses a car. Primarily uses it for countryside trips. Within London prefers public transport (Tube) due to crowding, or walking/cycling. Car use is mainly on weekends, occasionally with his girlfriend to dine out. |
| 2 | Have you ever considered renting out your car (or renting someone else’s) when it’s not in use? Why or why not? | Explore openness to the concept and initial perceptions of peer-to-peer car rental. | Has not considered it because he is unsure if companies offering that service exist nowadays. |
| 3 | What concerns or doubts would you have about letting someone else use your car? | Identify barriers such as trust, safety, insurance, and vehicle condition. | Main concern is cleanliness and whether the person would take proper care of the car. Lack of trust in strangers, uncertainty about their cleanliness and responsibility. |
| 4 | What features or guarantees would make you feel comfortable using a platform like this? | Discover key requirements for adoption (e.g., insurance coverage, vetting process, GPS tracking). | Assurance that the car will be returned completely clean (e.g., vacuumed) and in good condition. Ability to choose renters based on ratings/reviews within the app. |
| 5 | How do you currently handle situations when you need a car but don’t have access to one? | Understand the renter side’s needs, urgency, and willingness to pay. | In the city: uses bike or Tube. For countryside: takes train or rents a car if distance is far from city center. |
| 6 | What price or compensation would make renting out your car worthwhile for you? | Gauge the financial motivators and acceptable pricing models. | Depends on frequency. Would accept ~£100 per trip up to four times a month, or annual equivalent of £45K–50K if frequent. |
| 7 | If a service like ShareCarCo was launched in your city tomorrow, what would make you try it immediately—or what would stop you? | Identify strongest motivators and deal-breakers for adoption. | As a client: lower fares than London’s current services, faster and more reliable. As an owner: assurance of car’s return in clean and good condition, with a full tank. |

#### Situations
| Situation | What? | How? | Why? | Who? |
|-----------|-------|------|------|------|
| 1 | Owner rarely uses car during weekdays | Prefers Tube and walking to avoid city traffic | City is crowded, car is inefficient for daily commute | Remote worker in London |
| 2 | Hesitation to rent out car | Avoids renting to strangers without trust or proof of responsibility | Fears damage or poor maintenance of vehicle | Car owner concerned about cleanliness and care |
| 3 | Needs a vehicle for countryside trips | Rents a car or uses train when personal car not available | Trips are occasional and distance sometimes exceeds convenient train reach | Remote worker, occasional traveler |
| 4 | Willing to use platform if conditions met | Would adopt service if cleaning and vetting guarantees are provided | Wants assurance of safe return and positive user history | Potential P2P car-sharing participant |

| # | Question | Purpose | Response |
|---|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 |Can you tell me about the last time you wanted to review something from a class? How did you do it?|Understand the student’s current strategies for reviewing material and identify gaps or inefficiencies the app could address.  |Review classes by searching in sources from school were theres is a center of information with content from each class |
| 2 |How do you currently take and organize your notes?  | Learn about their current note-taking system | Takes notes using a notebook by subject with notes like bulletpoints with relevant ideas |
| 3 |Can you describe a time when you missed an important explanation in class? What happened?| Identify frustration points that the app could solve |Happens a lot of times in classes while taking notes because the teacher goes to fast and this slows the learning process |
| 4 |What kind of tools or resources would help you better capture and revisit class content?| Get direct input from students about features they would value, so the solution aligns with real needs. | Summaries of the class with the main ideas and recordings from the teachers|
| 5 |How useful would it be to have an app with AI that make you key points of your classes?  | Evaluate the appeal of the interactive notes and AI content |It would be amazing because it would help to be at the pace of the class |

#### Situations
| Situation | What? | How? | Why? | Who? |
|-----------|-------|------|------|------|
| 1 | The student writes notes by hand in a notebook or types long paragraphs in a text document during class. | They focus intensely on copying information, sometimes missing the context or examples while writing. Their head is down most of the time, and they rarely make eye contact with the professor. | Writing everything manually is time-consuming, and students struggle to capture both completeness and accuracy in real time. | The student, possibly classmates doing the same, and the teacher delivering the lecture. |
| 2 | The professor moves quickly from one topic to another while explaining complex concepts. | The student writes frantically, skipping words and abbreviating heavily. They show signs of stress and frustration when unable to keep up. | The pace of the lecture outstrips the student’s note-taking speed, causing important details to be lost. | The student and the professor in a live classroom setting. |
| 3 | The student recalls that the professor gave a valuable example or explanation but it wasn’t written down in the notes. | They try to reconstruct it from memory or ask classmates, but the details are vague and inconsistent. | Spoken insights disappear if not documented, and memory fades quickly without a recording to revisit. | The student, classmates (who may or may not remember the same details), and the professor as the source of the information. |

| # | Question | Purpose | Response |
|---|----------|----------|---------|

| 3 | Do you think the teacher would give you permission to record the class? | Validating a key condition for the Sound Classroom solution to work. | He doesn't think he should ask permission to record the class in most cases if he's not going to make it public and it's just for his friends, there shouldn't be a problem. Otherwise, he should ask the teacher, but he thinks most teachers would say yes. |
| 4 | Would you like to receive the notes in a notebook, or would you prefer audio? | Validate the student's preference between a traditional method (written notes) and the method proposed by the solution (audio recordings), to understand which one is more widely accepted. | He doesn't like either format. |
